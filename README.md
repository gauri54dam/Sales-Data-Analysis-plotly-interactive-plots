# Sales-Data-Analysis-plotly-interactive-plots


**The purpose of the analysis is to focus on how product sales data to be utilized to make data driven decisions.**

**The dataset is a set of products with multiple features. The classifier model suggests if following product will be sold or not based on these features.**

**It is important to note that even though many products are present in inventory, only about 10% sell each year and many of the products only have a single sale in the course of a year.**

**Thus the classifier model backed by data science analysis like tree analysis and boosting methods provides binary classification that can be used as the main determinant evaluating the inventory.**
